REmote DIctionary Server (REDIS) is an open source, in-memory data structure store which was created by [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://snip.ly/l01vs) in 2009 for real-time web analytics. This open source project had been sponsored by VMware and Pivotal Software, and since June 2015, has been sponsored by [Redis Labs](http://snip.ly/3t3va). According to [Redis Day TLV 2016](http://snip.ly/1wzk1), [Redis](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/tag/redis/) has gained lots of adoption in thousands of companies including American Express, Atlassian, Ariba, [Facebook](http://www.mulesoft.com/cloud-connectors/facebook-integration-connector), Intuit, TripAdvisor, [Twitter](http://www.mulesoft.com/cloud-connectors/twitter-integration-connector), and Verizon.

You can use Redis to cache a user profile, create a leaderboard, track real-time activities on a website, implement a spam filtering system, use it as a message queue, and more. At MuleSoft, we have seen customers use Redis as a cache storage layer while using [MongoDB](http://www.mulesoft.com/cloud-connectors/mongodb-integration-connector) as a persistent message storage layer, to process huge amounts of payroll and employee data with Redis Cluster, and as a [NoSQL](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/tag/nosql/) database. To support the growing number of customers leveraging Redis, we are thrilled to release the Anypoint [Connector](https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector) for Redis today.

Here is a quick example of how to use the Redis [Connector](https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector), compatible with Redis 2.8, 3.0 and 3.2. This [demo app](http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-redis-connector/) allows you to test basic operations of Redis [Connector](https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector). The app consists of two flows; the first flow shows 12 different operations which will be triggered by your choice, the second flow shows you a web page where you can pick an operation.

Let’s configure this Redis [Connector](https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector) first. Go to Global Elements, and find “Redis.” After selecting “Redis,” click on “Edit”.

[![Redis Configuration2](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Redis-Configuration2.png)](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Redis-Configuration2.png)

In the Redis: Configuration, you can specify the configuration of your Redis server. You could directly add your Redis Server information in the configuration, but I recommend that you use the properties file to add your configuration information. Since I’m running a Redis Server locally on my Mac, the configuration of my Redis Server I will use looks like this:

[![Redis server](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-29-at-4.12.05-PM.png)](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-29-at-4.12.05-PM.png)

*config.host=localhost**config.connectionTimeout=60000**config.port=6379*
After you complete the configuration for your Redis environment, run the app. When you open up a browser and hit localhost:8081, your browser will show the following page.

[![localhost:8081](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-29-at-4.13.45-PM-1024x727.png)](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-29-at-4.13.45-PM.png)

Since implementing a leaderboard is one of main use cases, I’d like to show an example of using a sorted set. When you scroll down on the webpage, you will see the following page.

[![redis sort](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-29-at-4.24.56-PM-1024x416.png)](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-29-at-4.24.56-PM.png)

I added the following data to a sorted set called “Max the Mule.”

| **Key**      | **Value** | **Score** |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Max the Mule | Nathan    | 50        |
| Max the Mule | Anton     | 70        |
| Max the Mule | Ashley    | 110       |
| Max the Mule | Alex      | 150       |

I’m only interested in those who scored higher than 100, so when I put the following information in “Get range by score”, Redis will show only Ashley and Alex who scored more than 100.
